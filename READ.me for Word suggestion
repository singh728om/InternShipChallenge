Setting up
Let’s get a fresh Fedora 30 VM in a Vagrant box and set it up:

$ vagrant box add https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/30/Cloud/x86_64/images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-Vagrant-30-1.2.x86_64.vagrant-virtualbox.box --name Fedora-30
Create a Vagrantfile with the following contents:

# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "Fedora-30"

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "2048"
   end
end

Then, let’s bring up the VM:

$ vagrant up
Once the VM is up, let’s SSH into it:

$ vagrant ssh
Once we are in the VM:

 $ sudo dnf remove bash-completion
 $ sudo dnf install bpftrace
 $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iovisor/bpftrace/master/tools/execsnoop.bt -o execsnoop.bt
 $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iovisor/bpftrace/master/tools/statsnoop.bt -o statsnoop.bt
On a terminal, (Terminal 1), type in $ git <TAB><TAB> (the space between git and <TAB><TAB> is important). The only suggestions you get will be the files in the directory you are in. Not very helpful suggestions, you say. I know - and that’s because we uninstalled a package which would have magically done that for us. (bash-completion). Let’s keep it that way for now.
